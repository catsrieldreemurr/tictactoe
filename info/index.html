        <p>This is a poorly written remake of Tic-Tac-Toe</p>
        <p>Why? I was bored, Really.</p>
        <p>This is probably my most advanced project yet!</p>
        <p>Quite proud of it actually.</p>

        <div class="newline">
            <p>This is a Local-Multiplayer Only game.</p>
            <p>Why not add a AI or something? Because I am too lazy to code that.</p>
            <p>Maybe i'll add it in the future. It might be a challenge because of how terrible my code is.</p>
            <p>I am going to have to rewrite my code someday. For now, this works.</p>
